- Credit card debt (Discover $1,500, BOA $400) should be prioritized due to high interest rates
- IRS debt needs to be determined and addressed
- Fred debt is deferred until financially comfortable
- Current financial constraints limit immediate repayment capacity
- Additional income sources needed to accelerate debt repayment
