## Notes

This commitment is about actively maintaining and strengthening the relationship through:
1. Financial responsibility (paying off debt)
2. ADHD management (treatment, research, home maintenance)
3. Proactive care (gestures, thoughtfulness, leading)
4. Respectful boundaries (remembering preferences, not interrupting, managing defensiveness)

The relationship is a priority that requires consistent attention and effort, especially given ADHD challenges with memory and executive function.
