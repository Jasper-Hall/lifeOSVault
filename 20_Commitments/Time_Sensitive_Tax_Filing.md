# Commitment: Tax Filing

## Status

**Priority:** URGENT  
**Deadline:** Before trust ends  
**Type:** Financial/legal obligation

## Context

- Living off educational trust money since mid-2024
- Trust can cover difference in income tax caused by stipends received
- Must file taxes while trust is still active to take advantage of this coverage
- Trust expiration timeline rapidly approaching (~3 months until reduction, then full expiration after graduation)

## Required Actions

- [ ] Gather all tax documents
- [ ] Prepare tax filing
- [ ] Coordinate with trust to cover income tax difference
- [ ] File taxes before trust expiration

## Notes

This is time-sensitive and must be completed while trust is still active. Failure to file in time could result in having to cover income tax difference out of pocket, which would worsen financial position.
