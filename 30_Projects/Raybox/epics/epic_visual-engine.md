# Generative Visual Engine Epic

## Description

Build the modular Three.js + GLSL shader system that produces rich, procedural visuals driven by audio features.

## Goals

- Modular effects system (registry-based architecture)
- Audio-reactive visual generation (not just volume-reactive)
- Multiple visual effects (metaballs, particle networks, bloom)
- Creative control parameters

## Notes

Core visualization engine exists but needs simplified parameter mapping UI for non-technical users.
