# Creative Controls

## Description

As a user, I want intuitive visual parameters (color palettes, camera motion, modulation depth, object types, timing curves, layer blending) to enable distinct personal aesthetics.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Color palette controls
- [ ] Camera motion controls
- [ ] Modulation depth controls
- [ ] Object type selection
- [ ] Timing curve controls
- [ ] Layer blending options
- [ ] Intuitive, non-technical UI

## Related Tasks

## Notes

Current UI is too complex. Needs MIDI-like control patterns.
