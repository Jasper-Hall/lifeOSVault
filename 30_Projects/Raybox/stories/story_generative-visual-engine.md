# Generative Visual Engine

## Description

As a user, I want Raybox to generate rich, procedural visuals driven by extracted audio features (not just volume-reactive gimmicks) using a modular Three.js + GLSL shader system.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Modular effects system (registry-based)
- [ ] Audio-reactive visuals (driven by audio features)
- [ ] Multiple visual effects available
- [ ] Real-time preview
- [ ] High-quality rendering

## Related Tasks

- [[task_add-visual-effects|Add additional visual effects]]

## Notes

Core engine exists. Needs simplified UI for non-technical users.
