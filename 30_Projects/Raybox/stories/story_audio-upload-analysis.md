# Audio Upload & Analysis

## Description

As a user, I want to upload stems or full mixes and have Raybox automatically analyze tempo, frequency bands, amplitude dynamics, and onset events, caching the results for fast iteration.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Upload audio files (stems or full mixes)
- [ ] Automatic analysis of tempo, frequency bands, amplitude dynamics, onset events
- [ ] Analysis results cached for fast iteration
- [ ] Analysis displayed in UI
- [ ] Support for common audio formats

## Related Tasks

- [[task_audio-caching-persistence|Implement audio caching persistence]]
- [[task_audio-analysis-optimization|Optimize audio analysis performance]]

## Notes

Core functionality exists but needs persistence and optimization.
