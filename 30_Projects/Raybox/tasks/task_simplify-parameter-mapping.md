# Simplify parameter mapping interface

## Context

Current parameter mapping UI is complex and not suitable for non-technical users. Needs to be simplified to MIDI-like control patterns.

## Notes

- Replace complex mapping UI with MIDI-like controls
- Focus on: transient detection, chroma, volume, brightness
- File targets: `apps/web/src/components/ui/MappingSourcesPanel.tsx`, `apps/web/src/hooks/use-audio-features.ts`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] MIDI-like control interface
- [ ] Simplified parameter mapping
- [ ] Intuitive for non-technical users
- [ ] Supports transient, chroma, volume, brightness mapping
