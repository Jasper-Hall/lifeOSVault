# Values & Non-Goals

## Values in Practice

Values are inferred from what I protect and return to under pressure:

- My relationship
- My personal projects
- My dreams and long-term vision
- Sleep, health, and mental stability
- Agency, autonomy, and personal space
- Freedom over rigid obligation

Work feels meaningful after the fact when:
- I help others
- I bring a personal vision into reality

## Non-Negotiables

I am no longer willing to sacrifice:
- Sleep
- Mental and physical health
- My sense of agency
- Personal space and alone time
- Dignity or values

## Explicit Non-Goals

I am **not** optimizing for:
- Fame
- Clout
- External markers of success
- Large-scale status games

Metrics that distort me:
- Follower counts
- Public attention without substance

## "Good Enough" Life (Current Definition)

A good enough life right now looks like:
- Financial stability
- Freedom to choose how I spend my time
- Space to explore my interests
- A small circle of friends I see regularly
- Not being beholden to others' expectations

LifeOS should respect these boundaries and avoid pushing against them.
