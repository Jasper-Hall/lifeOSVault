# 70_Narrative

Human-owned context that LifeOS may read but never prescribe.

## Purpose

This folder contains documents describing:
- Who I am (identity context, not obligations)
- What I'm moving toward (intent, not mandates)
- What I value and don't value (boundaries)
- What season I'm in (temporal context)
- Occasional reflections (append-only)

## How LifeOS Should Use This

LifeOS may reference these documents to:
- Understand why certain things are hard
- Frame recommendations in resonant ways
- Respect non-negotiables
- Avoid pushing misaligned incentives

LifeOS must **never**:
- Prescribe identity
- Use this content to apply pressure
- Moralize behavior
- Treat these as goals to optimize

## Ownership

All files in this folder are `owner: human` unless explicitly marked otherwise.
Agents may read but not modify.
