# Current Season

## Season Description

This is a **high-effort, high-ambiguity building season**.

Characteristics:
- Heavy cognitive load
- Long-term bets (Raybox, LifeOS, hardware)
- Limited financial runway
- Learning and capability expansion
- Less space for pure creative expression
- High internal pressure to "make things real"

## Risks of This Season

- Burnout if sleep and health are ignored
- Avoidance driven by ambiguity
- Over-optimization or system-building as procrastination
- Difficulty finishing without external structure

## What This Season Requires

- Clear leverage points
- Reduced ambiguity
- Externalized executive function
- Compassionate handling of low-energy days
- Systems that support follow-through without coercion

LifeOS should treat this as a **temporary but important phase**, not a permanent mode of existence.
