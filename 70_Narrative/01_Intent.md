# Intent

This document captures directional intent rather than fixed goals or identity.

## Directional Focus

I am intentionally moving toward becoming a **builder**:
- Someone who designs and constructs systems, tools, and artifacts
- Someone who can translate vision into reality through technical skill
- Someone who creates leverage through thoughtful systems rather than brute force

This direction has emerged through action, not aspiration:
- Live electronic music systems (purgeFiles)
- Hardware instrument exploration
- Graduate study in interactive media and entrepreneurship
- Software and AI-assisted tool building

## What I Am Actively Trying to Move Toward

- Financial independence and stability
- Making my ideas real and visible in the world
- Sharing work rather than hiding it
- Community, friendships, and collaboration
- Experiences beyond being home-bound
- A life that feels expansive rather than stalled

## What I Am Actively Trying to Move Away From

- Stagnation
- Financial precarity
- Loneliness
- Being stuck in one place
- Endless ideation without follow-through

Intent here is directional and revisable.
LifeOS should treat it as context, not obligation.
