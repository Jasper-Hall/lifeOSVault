# Identity (Context Only)

This document describes the lived reality, tendencies, strengths, and constraints of the person using LifeOS.
It exists solely as contextual reference for reasoning and explanation.
It does not prescribe behavior, goals, or identity obligations.

## Current Lived Reality

I am currently in a deep building phase of my life.

Most of my time and energy goes toward:
- AI-assisted development of software and systems (Raybox, LifeOS, related tools)
- Hardware and systems thinking connected to long-term creative goals
- Graduate school work (MS in Entrepreneurship & Innovation at the University of San Francisco)

Traditional creative output (music, art) is not central right now.
Instead, I am focused on **building tools for creative work**, with the expectation that this will open space for future expression.

## Responsibilities I Carry

Regardless of choice, I am currently responsible for:
- My relationship (fiancé)
- Caring for pets (cat and two mice)
- Maintaining my household
- Graduate school obligations
- Managing finances tied to an educational trust:
  - $3600/month for now
  - Drops to $1800/month in ~3 months
  - Full income responsibility after graduation
  - Monthly expense reporting required

These responsibilities meaningfully shape my available energy and risk tolerance.

## Non-Negotiable Constraints

- Location: San Francisco
- Health: ADHD, chronic fatigue via UARS
- Finances: limited runway until additional income is secured

These constraints are not failures or temporary inconveniences — they are facts LifeOS should respect.

## Energy Patterns

### What drains me:
- Busy work
- Bureaucracy
- Stagnation
- Tasks that feel meaningless or uninteresting

### What restores me:
- Creative and technical building
- Research and learning tied to active projects
- Visible progress
- Friends and social connection
- Music
- Time in nature
