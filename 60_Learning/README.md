# 60_Learning

Instrumental and ambient learning resources.

## Purpose

This folder contains learning materials in two modes:

### Instrumental Learning
Learning that unblocks goals or resolves specific blockers:
- Technical skills needed for current projects
- Knowledge gaps preventing progress
- Time-sensitive capability building

### Ambient Learning
Low-pressure learning that compounds over time:
- Background research
- Curiosity-driven exploration
- Future preparation

## Guidelines

- Learning is never used to delay action indefinitely
- Instrumental learning takes priority during high-pressure seasons
- Ambient learning is for low-energy or passive moments
- No queues, no obligation

## Structure

Files may include:
- Research notes
- Tutorial references
- Capability tracking
- Learning logs
