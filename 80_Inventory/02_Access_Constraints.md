# Access Constraints

What limits or enables access to resources, opportunities, and capabilities.

## Geographic Constraints

**Location:** San Francisco, Outer Richmond  
**Constraint:** Must remain in San Francisco until fiancée graduates from doctoral program (2.5-3.5 years remaining)  
**Status:** Non-negotiable constraint

## Financial Access

## Network/Relationships

**Mentor Connections:**
- **Chris Kucinski** (Critter & Guitari founder)
  - Status: Connection exists but stale (6 months since last contact)
  - Location: SF/Silicon Valley area
  - Expertise: Hardware instrument design, creative tech startup growth
  - Action needed: Reconnect to maintain relationship

**Industry Access:**
- Hardware meetup community (Oakland Hardware meetup, SF Hardware & Manufacturing events)
- Graduate school network (USF MSEI program)
- Potential internship connections (Windborne Systems, Ato, Clearspace, Pika AI - outreach in progress)

## Technical Access

## Notes

Access constraints significantly shape what's feasible:
- Geographic constraint limits opportunities outside SF
- Financial constraints (credit score, debt) limit flexibility
- Time constraints (work + school) limit project work hours
- Workspace not set up is immediate blocker
- Stale mentor connection needs reconnection

These constraints are facts to work with, not failures to overcome.
