# Decision: USF Practicum vs Internship & Raybox Strategic Approach

## What Was Decided

1. **Practicum over Internship:** Chose to avoid getting an internship as part of USF coursework and instead pursue a structured practicum around launching my own business.

2. **Raybox as Strategic Enabler:** Decided to pursue Raybox (not Rheome) as the primary business focus for the practicum, with the strategic understanding that:
   - Raybox is not the ultimate goal
   - Main goal is to launch Rheome
   - Raybox serves as a lighter-weight, leaner, recurring revenue model (SaaS) business
   - Purpose: Create dependable passive income source before undertaking the expensive and difficult endeavor of founding a hardware company (Rheome)

## When Decided

January 2025 (recent decision, still being refined)

## Rationale

### Why Practicum Over Internship

- **Alignment with long-term goals:** Internship would provide experience but delay progress toward launching own ventures
- **Immediate value creation:** Practicum allows building something that can generate revenue and support future goals
- **Strategic positioning:** Building own business aligns with 10-year roadmap of becoming a founder/creative technologist
- **Financial necessity:** Need to generate income quickly; internship may not provide sufficient financial support

### Why Raybox Before Rheome

**Strategic Sequencing:**
1. **Raybox = Software SaaS (lighter-weight)**
   - Lower upfront costs
   - Faster to market
   - Recurring revenue model
   - Can be built and maintained with existing resources
   - Target: Ramen profitability ($5-8k/month) to extend runway

2. **Rheome = Hardware Company (expensive, difficult)**
   - Requires significant capital investment
   - Manufacturing complexity
   - Longer development cycles
   - Higher risk
   - Needs financial foundation before undertaking

**The Logic:**
- Build Raybox first to create financial stability
- Use Raybox revenue to fund Rheome development
- Raybox provides "dependable passive income" to reduce financial pressure
- Once Raybox is generating recurring revenue, can take on the risk and expense of hardware company

## Context & Constraints

**Financial Reality:**
- Current income gap: ~$3,720/month vs $4,200-$5,800 expenses (in ~3 months)
- No savings or other financial resources
- Debt obligations totaling ~$17,300+
- Need additional income sources urgently

**Time Constraints:**
- Work: 26 hrs/week (Tues-Fri, 6am-12:30pm)
- School: ~10 hrs/week (Wed-Fri classes)
- Limited available hours for project work

**Strategic Context:**
- Raybox MVP is already in advanced development
- Rheome requires more R&D and capital
- Professional Development Plan outlines 10-year roadmap where Phonoglyph (Raybox) enables Rheome

## Current Status

**Still Deciding:**
- Still sorting out what business to pursue for practicum
- Raybox has been the plan but considering alternatives
- Main goal remains launching Rheome

**Key Question:**
Is Raybox the right choice for the practicum, or should another business be pursued?

## Notes

This decision represents a strategic sequencing approach: build financial foundation (Raybox) before taking on higher-risk venture (Rheome). The rationale is sound, but the specific business choice for practicum may still need refinement.

The decision to avoid internship aligns with the goal of financial independence and building own ventures, but requires careful execution to ensure the practicum provides sufficient structure and support.

## Revisit Criteria

Revisit this decision if:
- Raybox development stalls or proves unviable
- Alternative business opportunity emerges that better serves the goal
- Financial situation changes significantly
- Practicum requirements conflict with business launch timeline
