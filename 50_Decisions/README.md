# Decisions

Important decisions and their rationale.

Used to prevent re-decision fatigue.

## Purpose

This section documents significant decisions that have been made, along with the reasoning behind them. When similar questions arise later, these decisions can be referenced rather than re-debated.

## Decision Files

Each decision should be documented in its own file with:
- What was decided
- When it was decided
- Why it was decided (rationale)
- Context and constraints that influenced the decision
- Related goals, projects, or commitments
