## Notes

These goals align with the 10-year roadmap outlined in [[Professional Development Plan]]. The path is unconventional by design—building a practice that weaves together creativity, technology, and entrepreneurship rather than fitting into existing industry categories.

Success depends on:
- Achieving ramen profitability with early ventures (Raybox)
- Building audience and community gradually
- Maintaining creative integrity while building sustainable businesses
- Iterating quickly based on user feedback
- Building tools that resonate with other artists

The goal is not to climb a corporate ladder, but to become a synthesis of artist, engineer, and entrepreneur—building the creative tools of tomorrow.
