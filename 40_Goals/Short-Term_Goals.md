## Requirements That May Block These Goals

- Financial constraints (debt repayment requires income stability)
- Time constraints (cafe + school schedule limits available hours)
- Technical blockers (Raybox MVP completion requires specific features)
- Energy/capacity constraints (ADHD management affects all goals)

## Notes

These goals are interconnected:
- LifeOS integration supports all other goals by reducing ambiguity
- Schedule integration enables consistent work on other goals
- Financial stability (debt repayment) reduces stress and enables focus
- Raybox MVP completion is a critical milestone for financial independence
