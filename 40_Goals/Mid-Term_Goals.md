## Requirements That May Block These Goals

- **Financial:** Income gap is critical (~$3,720/month vs $4,200-$5,800 expenses in ~3 months)
- **Time:** Balancing cafe work, school, and project development
- **Technical:** Raybox MVP completion is prerequisite for launch
- **Market:** User acquisition and product-market fit for Raybox

## Notes

The financial independence goal is the most critical and time-sensitive. All other goals support or depend on achieving this milestone. The tomobo collab and Rheome presence building are important for long-term trajectory but secondary to immediate financial stability.
