My career trajectory exists in the space where creativity, technology, and entrepreneurship overlap. Over the past decade I’ve moved fluidly between the realms of music, fashion, graphic design, film, visual art, community building, generative and interactive media– and more recently–hardware and software prototyping/development and product design, gradually forming a multidisciplinary practice informed by my passions and curiosities. Now in the process of completing my Master of Science in Entrepreneurship and Innovation, I’m aiming to coalesce this diverse creative toolkit into a sustainable entrepreneurial path. 

This Professional Development Plan outlines how I intend to build a long-term career that integrates these various facets of my background with my newly-acquired entrepreneurial knowledge, crafting a vision for my future that will enable me to pursue my creative ambitions while building sustainable companies that can support both myself and my family. This document outlines my ten-year roadmap toward becoming a technically capable creative technologist and founder, analyzes the industry landscape, identifies viable functional roles for entry, and describes the mentor relationships, potential internship opportunities, and a new venture concept that will support my growth. Ultimately, this document serves as a personal blueprint for a successful career at the intersection of art, technology, entrepreneurship, and community building. 

	My professional development roadmap is built around several parallel but complementary trajectories: 

* Developing deep technical fluency and professional credibility within creative technology, generative media, and rapid prototyping.  
* Launching and scaling various entrepreneurial ventures such as Phonoglyph, Rheome, and future projects under the Entropy Harvest Bureau umbrella.  
* Building a global audience and creative community around my work, enabling a self-sustaining distribution network, greater industry visibility, and a foundation for long-term, compounding opportunities.

Together, these paths will enable me to build financially sustainable companies while maintaining creative independence, contributing meaningful tools to the music and creator technology ecosystems, and building long-term cultural influence.

To ground this roadmap in the concrete projects that define my practice, it is important to briefly outline the core ventures that anchor these trajectories. Phonoglyph is my emerging software platform that transforms user-uploaded music into synchronized generative visuals, serving musicians, labels, and promoters who need to quickly create compelling video content without the complexity and time commitment of tools like TouchDesigner or After Effects. In parallel, Rheome exists as my music hardware and software studio, an R\&D practice focused on building expressive, improvisational instruments for electronic musicians. One of its flagship explorations is Mutax, an experimental performance interface that combines gestural control and a real-time musical mutation system to create a uniquely embodied and improvisational hardware instrument. These projects all sit under the conceptual umbrella of Entropy Harvest Bureau (eHB), a narrative and organizational framework that ties together my artistic, technological, and entrepreneurial work. eHB provides a cohesive identity for my broader ecosystem of tools, artworks, and ventures, enabling them to evolve in parallel while maintaining a unified creative framework.

With this context in place, the following ten-year development plan outlines the annual milestones that will allow me to deepen my technical fluency, grow these ventures, and cultivate a global creative community around my work.

With my roadmap defined, the next step is to take a deeper look at the creative technology landscape that I am entering and contributing to through my work, ventures, and long term aspirations. Creative technology is an umbrella term encompassing the creative application of various technologies across multiple fields—from software tools for artistic production to generative and interactive media via creative coding, hardware instruments and wearable tech, AR/XR/VR experiences, game development, speculative design and rapid prototyping, and immersive web experiences. While difficult to define as a single industry, my career trajectory intersects with three primary segments: music technology (software and hardware tools for music production and performance), the creator tools economy (tools enabling content creators to produce and edit content for social media), and interactive/experiential media (agencies creating immersive technological experiences for brands and cultural institutions). 

Taking a closer look at the primary segment I’m interested in, the music technology market encompasses digital audio workstations (DAWs), synthesizers, MIDI controllers, and audio processing tools, the foundational toolset enabling contemporary electronic music creation and performance. The global music production software market reached $2.67 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow to $3.74 billion by 2030 \[1\], growing at 7.7% CAGR \[2\] and the broader audio equipment market is forecasted to reach $39.4 billion by 2030 \[3\]. One particularly relevant trend within this space is the sustained growth of the modular synthesizer market over the past 15 years, driven by the Eurorack format. This niche segment has evolved into a remarkably vibrant ecosystem of over 700 manufacturers, ranging from boutique one-person operations to established legacy players such as Roland and Moog. Each manufacturer produces individual synthesizer modules that can interact with other modules and be combined into cohesive systems, giving users the ability to design bespoke instruments in virtually unlimited configurations from the modules of their preference. Notably, this industry is largely fueled by passion and crowdfunding rather than investment capital, and many of its most popular companies still operate as small, independent shops. For my own venture, Rheome, this ecosystem is especially validating: it demonstrates sustained demand for innovative, tactile, and idiosyncratic hardware instruments, and it exemplifies a boutique manufacturer model that is culturally resonant, financially viable, and aligned with my artistic sensibilities. The popularity of modular synths also reflects a broader trend in music technology known as the “DAW-less” movement—a growing preference among electronic musicians for standalone hardware devices over computer-based production, which has largely been the reigning music-creation paradigm since its emergence in the mid 90’s. This shift is driven in part by knowledge workers seeking to separate their creative practice from the computers they use for work, increasing the demand for hardware solutions such as grooveboxes, drum machines, modular systems, and synthesizers. Collectively, these trends reinforce the relevance of the hardware-focused approach behind Rheome and underscore the long-term market opportunity for innovative, unique, purpose-built electronic musical instruments.

The second major sub-category within the creative technology landscape relevant to my work is the creator-tools ecosystem, which comprises software platforms that enable individuals to produce and edit digital content for social media and digital distribution. This market includes products like CapCut, Canva, RunwayML, Pika, and Descript, and forms part of the broader digital-art tools market, which was valued at $4.7 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach $8.5 billion by 2030 (10.2% CAGR) \[5\]. AI-driven creative-media tools are accelerating this growth, with the AI in music segment alone expected to reach $5.5 billion by 2032 at a 27% CAGR \[4\], reflecting rapid adoption of automation and generative-AI-powered content transformation. These trends reflect a shift toward tools that are faster, more accessible, and more expressive, particularly for creators who need to produce large quantities of visually engaging content without the complexity of traditional professional software. My venture, Phonoglyph, is uniquely positioned within this landscape as an audiovisual tool offering expressive, audio-reactive visuals tailored to musicians and digital creators, bridging the gap between highly templatized apps and advanced, technical tools like After Effects.

The final segment I intend to engage with is interactive and experiential media, encompassing studios and agencies that design immersive, technology-driven experiences for brands, cultural institutions, and entertainment venues using tools such as TouchDesigner, Unity, projection mapping, AR/VR, and custom hardware/software systems.  The global experiential marketing market was valued at $32.6 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach $45.9 billion by 2030, growing at a 5.0% CAGR. \[6\] The immersive-technology market—encompassing AR/VR, projection mapping, and interactive installations—is projected to reach $134 billion by 2030\. \[7\]. Industry surveys indicate that 74% of brands increased their experiential-marketing budgets in 2024\. \[8\]. Key trends shaping this sector include demand for sensory, participation-based brand experiences, the expansion of AR/VR tooling, and marketers shifting away from digital-only campaigns toward hybrid physical-digital installations. The overall outlook points to continued growth as brands seek more memorable, high-impact ways to engage audiences, making this an attractive area for multidisciplinary creative technologists working across generative media, hardware/software prototyping, and interactive installations.

Within these various fields, some of the most influential companies exemplifying innovation and market leadership include Ableton in music technology, Canva in the creator-tools space, and teamLab in interactive and experiential media. Ableton is most renowned for its DAW, Ableton Live, which integrates studio production and live performance in a single platform, enabling musicians to experiment with non-linear, improvisational approaches to composition and performance. Canva democratizes graphic design with web-based tools for creating professional-quality visual content, expanding into video editing, presentations, and AI-assisted design, making it a cornerstone of the creator-tools ecosystem. teamLab is an interdisciplinary creative studio specializing in immersive digital installations, projection mapping, and interactive experiences, blending art, technology, and design to produce large-scale exhibitions for museums, cultural institutions, and public spaces.

Within this multifaceted landscape, my preferred functional role is founder and product designer, combining product vision, design strategy, and technical implementation to build innovative tools and experiences. As a founder, my role will encompass defining the company’s vision, shaping and overseeing development of products, leading multidisciplinary teams, and bridging creative, technical, and business considerations. While my primary goal is to found my own company, potential entry points that I may consider in order to gain initial experience include roles such as product designer**,** rapid prototyping engineer, or general creative technologist roles which would provide hands-on experience in both the development and conceptualization of tools, platforms, or immersive experiences. 

Examining founders who have successfully navigated similar paths provides insights for my own trajectory and the vision, resilience, and ingenuity required to execute my goals. In the case of Ableton, Co-founder and CEO Gerhard Behles grew up in Munich and studied computer science, working as a freelance electronic music writer, researcher and teacher. Seeking a software-based live performance solution for his electronic music project Monolake, he teamed up with bandmate Robert Henke and computer scientist Bernd Roggendorf to build the exact tool they were missing, a piece of software which eventually became Ableton Live. Formally founding the company with Roggendorf in 1999, Live quickly became known as one of the most innovative pieces of software for music creation and performance, and grew in popularity over the decades to cement the strong presence it holds within the musical landscape today \[9\]. Behles’s trajectory demonstrates that domain-specific knowledge and a hunger for making tools that don’t yet exist can be a powerful recipe for long term success, a validating prospect for my own current position as a creator of the tools I wish I had. 

Canva’s founder and CEO, Melanie Perkins, grew up in Perth, Australia and studied Communications Psychology and Commerce, tutoring students in graphic design on the side. Realizing first hand how unnecessarily difficult the leading design software tools were, she came up with the idea for a simplified and unified set of web-based design tools. Lacking the technical know-how and resources to execute her full vision, she started off building a smaller-scoped tool, Fusion Books, a platform which enabled schools to easily create yearbook designs. The business was a resounding success, but over time she outgrew it, still yearning to build the more general purpose design tool of her dreams. After a chance encounter with San Francisco venture capitalist Bill Tai, the seeds for what would eventually become Canva were planted, and after several years of investor pitching, technical recruiting, and building, Canva eventually launched in 2013 to a waitlist of 50,000 hungry users. Within a year, that user base doubled, and Canva grew to become a Unicorn by 2018, now with over 240 million monthly active users bringing in over $3 billion in annual revenue \[10\]. Perkins’ story demonstrates how understanding a user’s pain first hand, and having the drive and resilience to build a solution for that pain, can result in massive success, even without having the technical chops to build a software product. Sometimes the best tools are the simplest ones, and my product Phonoglyph is aimed to position itself as the Canva for audio-reactive video content, a medium which still lacks a sufficiently streamlined tool.

teamLab’s co-founder and CEO, Toshiyuki Inoko, developed an early fascination with creating immersive experiences, starting in childhood with elaborate pranks and classroom installations that transformed his school into a playful interactive environment \[11\]. He studied Architecture and Design at the University of Tokyo, and in 2001 co-founded teamLab to explore the intersection of art, technology, and human interaction. Beginning with small-scale collaborative projects integrating music and audience participatory visual elements, Inoko and his team gradually expanded into large-scale, multi-sensory installations that blend projection mapping, AR/VR, generative software, and physical environments \[12\]. Under his leadership, teamLab has grown to a collective of over 600 artists, programmers, and designers, producing globally recognized exhibitions that captivate audiences of all ages. Inoko’s trajectory demonstrates the value of play, interdisciplinary collaboration and technical experimentation, exhibiting a visionary approach to scaling a business built around pure creativity and joy. As a creative technologist who seeks to enrapture audiences through the multisensory experiences I create, Inoki’s career serves as an inspiring example of success in what I’d like to call the “awe economy.”

	To complement the lessons drawn from successful founders, I have assembled a mentor panel of industry professionals whose expertise spans music technology, creative software, and hardware innovation. Takuma Matsui, whom I met in New York last year, teaches at Berklee College of Music, works at a music software company called Output, and founded his own music software company called Rainbow Circuits, providing insight into both educational and commercial software landscapes. Jason Snell, teaches Ableton at NYU and founded Primary Assembly, a company developing brain-wave–based music creation tools, offering guidance on experimental and emerging technologies within an entrepreneurial context. Chris Kucinski, the founder of well-known synthesizer company Critter & Guitari, is based in the SF/Silicon Valley area and brings deep experience in hardware instrument design and creative tech startup growth. All founders themselves, this panel represents a rich resource for personalized advice, technical feedback, and strategic guidance along my path, helping me navigate the creative technology ecosystem while starting and growing my own ventures.  
	  
While I have yet to secure a position thus far, I am actively pursuing creative technology and hardware prototyping internships for the upcoming semester. I have reached out to Windborne Systems (creative internship focused on creating art from their weather ballon data), Ato (hardware assembly internship for an AI-powered elderly assistance product), Clearspace (a digital wellbeing app), and Pika AI (prompt artist role for generative AI video tools). Each opportunity offers experience directly transferable to my career trajectory, whether through data visualization and creative coding, hardware assembly and development, web design and rapid prototyping, or shaping creator tools. The ideal internship provides exposure to full-stack prototyping, mentorship from senior creative technologists or hardware engineers, and networking opportunities within Silicon Valley's creative tech ecosystem. I am continuing targeted outreach to tech startups, creative technology studios, and hardware accelerators while leveraging industry events and my MSEI network for introductions and preparing portfolio case studies to demonstrate technical capability.

With an internship under my belt, the most significant step toward establishing my career in creative technology is not just launching, but scaling, my venture Phonoglyph. With the MVP nearing completion, I plan to dedicate the final semester at USF to growing the company to a stage capable of sustaining me beyond graduation, refining its features, expanding its user base, and positioning it for long-term success in the creator tools ecosystem. As I have alluded to previously in this paper, Phonoglyph is a browser-based SaaS platform that transforms  user-uploaded music into synchronized visuals, enabling musicians, labels, and promoters to create compelling video content in minutes, not hours. With social media reigning as the primary promotional tool for today’s musicians, the ability to create captivating and brand-aligned video content is a necessity. Existing professional tools require months of training and a substantial time investment, while template-based competitors offer limited customization and generic results that don't align with artist branding. Phonoglyph bridges this gap by enabling deep customization and control within a streamlined and fast workflow. The platform analyzes separated audio stems for their frequency spectrum, onset detection (when a sound starts), and volume curves, converting their musical data into control parameters for visual effects. Offering a curated library of generative visual effects and filters, as well as the ability for users to upload their own photo and video content, Phonoglyph makes audio-reactive video creation easy. With a drag and drop interface to map musical features to visual parameters, users can quickly create stunning and complex visuals that move to the beat of their tracks. Rather than offering static templates, Phonoglyph renders real-time synchronized graphics that respond organically to musical structure, creating evolving visuals that reflect each artist's unique sonic identity through a streamlined workflow requiring no downloads or technical expertise.

The primary target market includes independent musicians, record labels, event promoters, and content creators. The business model centers on subscription tiers (Creator @ $15/month, Pro @ $29/month, Label/Team @ $59/month) with additional revenue from per-export fees and a future marketplace for community-contributed visual engines. The path to ramen profitability targets 150-200 paying subscribers within the first year, generating $5,000-8,000 in monthly recurring revenue against operating costs of $1,100-1,900 for cloud rendering, hosting, and marketing. The go-to-market strategy emphasizes closed beta testing among 20-30 users from music production communities, followed by public launch supported by content marketing through YouTube tutorials and a freemium acquisition funnel where watermarked exports serve as organic promotion. The final semester launch plan focuses on achieving validation with 250 signups and 50+ paying customers by month six, establishing the technical credibility and recurring revenue necessary to support my long-term creative technology career. Phonoglyph ultimately serves as a strategic enabler for the entire 10-year roadmap, validating my entrepreneurial capabilities while generating financial stability to invest in longer-term R\&D projects like Mutax and building an audience for the broader Entropy Harvest Bureau ecosystem.

The path I've outlined in this plan is unconventional by design. I'm not aiming to climb a corporate ladder or fit neatly into existing industry categories. Instead, I'm building a practice that weaves together my creativity with my nerdy passion for technology and building things, grounded in an entrepreneurial framework that will give me the foundation to thrive and live the life I want. I refuse to choose between becoming an artist, an engineer, or an entrepreneur, I am aiming to become the synthesis of all three. What excites me most about this creative technology landscape is that it rewards this kind of synthesis. The modular synth ecosystem thrives because individual makers bring both their technical skills and artistic sensibility to their instruments, teamLab captivates audiences around the world through their fusion of emotional expression and tech-enabled immersion. Technology is an amplifier and a portal for the creative spirit, from the first animal hides stretched over a drum to the most cutting-edge DSP algorithms, the tools we use are an extension of our souls. The goal of my career is to build the creative tools of tomorrow, the bullhorns of our humanity in a time when tech often takes us further apart from each other.

  The next decade will test whether I can sustain this vision financially while maintaining my creative integrity. Ramen profitability with Phonoglyph in Year 1 is my most critical milestone and will be the difference between independence and compromise. The mentor panel, internship experience, and industry connections I'm building now will provide the guidance and opportunities I need when challenges inevitably arise. But ultimately, success will depend on my ability to keep making things that resonate with other artists, to iterate quickly based on their feedback, and to build a community around work that matters to them. I'm inspired and energized by the founders whose careers I've studied, from Behles refusing acquisition offers to maintain Ableton's vision, Perkins simplifying design for the masses, and Inoko scaling teamLab while keeping joy and experimentation at its core. They prove it's possible to build influential, sustainable companies without sacrificing what makes the work meaningful. That's the standard I'm holding myself to, and this ten-year roadmap is my commitment to getting there.
