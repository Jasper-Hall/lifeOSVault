<!-- This file is system-generated. It surfaces the single most important action. -->

## Primary Action

**Complete workspace setup before classes start**

## Why This Action

- Classes start January 26 (11 days)
- Workspace not set up is blocking productive Raybox development
- Current work sessions are inefficient without proper setup
- This is a prerequisite for the building season ahead

## Time Estimate

2-3 hours focused work

## What Comes After

Begin Raybox MVP sprint targeting February 28 launch

| **Raybox MVP target** | 44 days (February 28) |
| **Graduation** | 167 days (July 1) |

## Active Constraints

- Work: Tues-Fri 6am-12:30pm (26 hrs/week)
- Classes: Wed-Fri various times (~10 hrs/week)
- Current capacity: Building season, high cognitive load

## Raybox Status

**Status:** In development  
**Blocker:** Technical - incomplete integration between backend systems and frontend UX  
**Next milestone:** MVP launch with first paying customer

## How to Update This File

This file should be regenerated by the system, typically:
- Daily at 6 AM (before barista shift)
- After major state changes
- When explicitly requested

Use the `get-current-date` skill for accurate timestamps.

To regenerate, the system should:
1. Read `01_StateSnapshot.md` for financial/health context
2. Read `02_CurrentPriorities.md` for priority stack
3. Check project blockers in `30_Projects/`
4. Check upcoming commitments in `20_Commitments/`
5. Surface the single highest-leverage action
