# 90_Archive

Completed or inactive material lives here.

## Purpose

Nothing is deleted. When items are:
- Completed
- No longer relevant
- Paused indefinitely
- Superseded by newer work

They move here rather than being deleted.

## Guidelines

- Archive retains full history for reference
- Items can be restored if needed
- Structure mirrors active folders when applicable
- Dated folders may be used for bulk archiving

## Why Archive Instead of Delete

- Preserves context for future decisions
- Allows revisiting past work
- Maintains institutional memory
- Reduces fear of committing to completion
